## ðŸ“Š Mock Data Overview

- **19 Geological Specimens** in database
- **25 Collection Items** with recent dates
- **5 Field Notes** with research data
- **Ocean-specific specimens** (Pillow Basalt, Black Smoker Sulfides, etc.)
- **Realistic confidence scores** (60-95%)
- **GPS coordinates** for all specimens

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Interactions to Try

1. **Search**: Type "Quartz" or "Basalt" in any search field
2. **Filter**: Use category filters to narrow results
3. **Sort**: Change sort order by date, name, or confidence
4. **Multi-Select**: Long-press items to enter selection mode
5. **Export**: Test CSV, PDF, JSON export options
6. **Navigation**: All screen transitions work smoothly
7. **Details**: Tap any specimen for full information

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

The app adapts to different screen sizes:
- Mobile phones (portrait)
- Tablets (portrait/landscape)
- Web browsers (responsive)

## âœ¨ Next Steps

To enhance the prototype further:
1. Connect real AI services (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic)
2. Implement actual camera capture
3. Add cloud storage with Supabase
4. Enable user authentication
5. Add offline data persistence
